## Current Features

## Known Issues
- Streaming and downloading audio and video simultaneously at resolutions exceeding 720p are restricted by YouTube's limitations.
- There are some UI issues with the download loading bar and the Downloads tab.

## Plans for the Future
- Enhancing the user interface for improved usability and reduced clutter
- Addressing playlist support functionality
- Resolving issues related to Queuing and Download initialization
- Introducing additional customization options for download speeds, concurrent downloads, etc.
- Implementing an Audio and Video Merge feature to expedite the merging process, with initial tests showing a download duration increase of 650%, I scrapped merging for this release until I come up with a faster method.
